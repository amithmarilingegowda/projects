Unlike tuple and list data type, a set is an unorderedsequence of items i.e. the order in which items of a setare
declared in a set is not the order in which they are stored because the objects are stored on the basis of their hash
value, which is calculated internally.

Hence the fastest way to know if the element is part of any data stucture is by using "Set".

Properties of a Set:
--------------------
   --> A set is mutable even i.e. we can insert a new item to it and can delete an existing item from it.

   --> We cannot store duplicate values in a set.  Because the order in which items of a set are stored
       is arbitrary, so there is no concept of accessing an item of a set using an index position.
